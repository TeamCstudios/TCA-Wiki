## Story

##### Season 1
In Episode 1, MrJo, Chew, and DjSlime are the protectors of CStudios Town, and are known as Team CStudios. A zombie plauge threatens the town, so they leave and find that a mysterious entity, later confirmed to be the demigod McMagma, is behind this.

In Episode 2 and 3, the party charters a boat to find McMagma. After narrowly escaping several disasters, they find Herobrine on Tropica Island, who curses Jo's descendants to eternal unhappiness.

In Episode 4, Jo, Chew, DjSlime, Zach, and Lance collect the Chaos Emeralds and face down McMagma. In the True Ending, McMagma is defeated (though not permanently) and Jo goes home to CStudios Town.

##### Season 2
The Hero Story follows Jo as he tries to collect everyone for the coronation, then finding that Bob, Jared and Riley are up to no good and have taken over most of West Astonia. The heroes liberate Mythlor and Sepstaris, then pursue Bob and Jared through the Rosquilite Kingdom.

However, in the Last Story, Team Hero and Team Dark put aside their differences to liberate Oliveport from Herobrine. Afterwards, Jo defeats McMagma, killing him for good (as of now).

##### Season 3
Jo is attending buisness in Georgetown when he finds out that the Georgyske Ûnôfhinklike Partij killed the previous king, his uncle, and rallies the heroes of the realm to face the threat.

#### Exploration
After defeating the GÛP, Jo is told by JTheGoldenHeart that Lance has shipwrecked himself on an as-of-yet undiscovered island east of East Astonia.

Jo then goes with Ashton, followed closely by Zach, then Chew and DjSlime, then Bob and Jared, followed by Riley, Mean, and Bronco.

During the fighting in the Chaos Emeralds Arc, Bob recruits his son Simon and the master assassin Ross to battle against Team CStudios, but both fail.
